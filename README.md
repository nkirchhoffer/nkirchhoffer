# Hello there ! :wave:

I am a Cloud Engineer (and also a Software Engineer student at IMT Atlantique, Nantes, France) working on various infrastructures, architectures and technologies. 

- I also work at BPCE-IT where my job is to make our infrastructure and applications reliable (using stress tests, and by defining standards) :computer:
- I am a certified Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer and Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer :wrench:
- I also work as a full-stack web developer, using technologies like NodeJS, PHP (with Laravel) and Vue to build websites :construction:
- I studied networks and telecommunications, which explain my interest for cloud computing ! :globe_with_meridians:

Currently working on :

- Setting up an on-edge multi-cloud Kubernetes cluster with [Netmaker](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker) and [K3s](https://k3s.io) with GitOps in mind :arrow_right: [Clebard Cloud](https://clebard.cloud)
- Building a service that allows your friends to add songs to your Spotify queue :arrow_right: [The Queue](https://github.com/the-queue)
- Writing articles on my blog :arrow_right: [nkirchho.dev](https://nkirchho.dev)

As I advocate for free and open-source software, all my personal (and sometimes more professional) projects are available on my GitHub profile or on my different organizations ! Feel free to support my work on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/nkirchho) :blush:
